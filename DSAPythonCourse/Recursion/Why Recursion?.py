# 1. Recursive thinking is really importanting in programming and helps you break down big problems into smaller onesd.
# when to choose recursion? 
# If you can divine the problem into similar sub problems
# Design an algorithim to compute nth
# Write code to list the n
# Implement a method to compute all

# 2. The prominent usage of recursion in data structures like trees and graphs.

# 3. Interviews (lol)

# 4. It is used in many algorithims (divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming)
