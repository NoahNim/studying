# When to use it:
#     When we can easily breaking down a problem into similar subproblem
#     When we are fine with extra overhead (both time and space complexity)
#     When we need a quick woeking solution instead of an efficient one
#     When traverse a tree
#     When we use memoization in recursion

# When to avoid it:
#     If time and space complexity matter for us, as recursion uses more memory.
#     Recursion can be slow.
